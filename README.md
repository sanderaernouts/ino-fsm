Docker container for running a Full Screen Mario server

Maintainer: Chris Collins \<collins.christopher@gmail.com\>

##Building and Running##

This is a [Docker](http://docker.com) container image.  You need to have Docker installed to build and run the container.

To build the image, change directories into the root of this repository, and run:

`docker build -t fsm .`  <-- note the period on the end

Once it finishes building, you can run the container with:

`docker run -d -p 80:80 fsm`

Then, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to start playing.

To improve startup speed, this image will not update with the latest version of the FullScreenMario software automatically once the initial image is built.  When a new update is released, run the `docker build` command from above to get the newest version.

##Extra steps for Mac OS X##

Docker needs a bit of help to run on a Mac, and most folks appear to be using ["boot2docker"](http://boot2docker.io/) to accomplish it.  If you use boot2docker, there are a few preliminary steps you'll need to take for the networking stuff to work:

    boot2docker init
    f_s_m_port=8801
    VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "tcp-port${f_s_m_port},tcp,,${f_s_m_port},,${f_s_m_port}"
    VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "udp-port${f_s_m_port},udp,,${f_s_m_port},,${f_s_m_port}"
    boot2docker up

...and then continue with the `docker build` and `docker run` commands from above.
